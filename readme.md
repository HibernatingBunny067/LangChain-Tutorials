# What is LangChain ? 
- LangChain is a python library used to build and manage LLM based applications 
- it provides seamless working with open source and paid LLM models which can be used to build GenAI apps
- Additionally it provides one line code for working with RAG and Agents 

## Day-01
- [x] learned about langchain basics like prompt template, output parser and chains
- [x] worked with Ollama to run LLMs locally 
- [x] created a small semantic search engine using 5 strings as documents and 1 query

## Day-02
- [x] learning about prompts, using Ollama and llama 3 made a basic offline paper summarizer
- [x] learned about different type of messages used in LLM prompting
- [x] chatprompt template and prompt template difference and when to use which one 

## Day-03
- [x] learned Runnables 
- [x] runnables effictively are a type of component which are standardized in LangChain and carry an invoke method which runs that particular runnable with the required inputs
- [x] runnables come in many flavours from LangChain itself, seq, parallel lambda and passthrough to name the most important ones
- [] starting document laoders the begining of RAG !!!

## Day-04
- [x] learned document loaders and how they work
- [x] went through text splitters and their types recurssive,semantic or length based and how the input params work
- [x] studied vector stores, went through popular ones like Chroma and FAISS
    - [x] understood their working and types 

## Day-05
- [x] currently working on retrievers, hope to make a project in some time (let's see)
